# Build Folder

This folder is used exclusively to store files related to the build process. It contains automatically generated files that are necessary for the compilation, bundling, and other build-related tasks.

## Important Notes:
- **Do not modify any files manually** within this folder.
- **Do not commit** the contents of this folder to version control (e.g., Git). These files are often generated from source code and can be recreated at any time during the build process.

By keeping this folder clean and dedicated solely to build artifacts, we ensure that our version control system remains focused on the source code.
